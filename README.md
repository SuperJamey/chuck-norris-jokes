# About

This app is for an exercise using Web App API's.
The challenge was to build something fun using one of the pre-determied API's.
I used the Chuck Norris API ( https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random )

The instructions were to build a single page application that uses
fetch() to retrieve information and display it on my website.
